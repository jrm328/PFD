## 🧭 About the Game

In **Postmarked for Doom**, the world may have ended...  
But the mail still needs delivering.

You play as a brave (or just very broke) courier trying to survive the ruins of civilization with a satchel full of packages and an unwavering sense of postal duty. Navigate treacherous streets, dodge bandits and biohazards, and rebuild a sense of normalcy—one delivery at a time.
